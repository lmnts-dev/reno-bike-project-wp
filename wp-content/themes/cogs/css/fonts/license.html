    	Webfont Software End User License Agreement
    </h2>
    <p>
    	THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT, by accessing, downloading, using or installing the Type Supply LLC (&ldquo;Type Supply&rdquo;) Font Software you expressly agree to the following terms:
    </p>
    <ol class="numeric">
    	<li>
    		This License is directed to use of the Type Supply Font Software as webfonts. Downloading Type Supply Font Software for use on a desktop, laptop or workstation is controlled and only permitted under a different License. If you wish to use and/or install the Type Supply Font Software on your desktop or personal computer or on a server for use and access by a desktop or personal computing device, you must secure a separate license. You further agree to exercise reasonable care to avoid unauthorized distribution of the Font Software. If you cannot or do not agree to the terms of this license, do not access or use and, if appropriate, return the software unused to Type Supply.
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		The Font Software will be transmitted for your use in the Web Open Font Format (&ldquo;WOFF&rdquo;) format and/or such other formats as Type Supply may determine or otherwise agree, at its discretion.
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		This non-exclusive, revocable license grants you limited rights to use the Font Software to style HTML and SVG documents using the CSS @font-face mechanism. Other embedding or linking uses or techniques, such as PDF, EPUB, iOS and/or Android native applications, Cuf√≥n or sIFR, are not permitted under this license and if so desired, require the purchase of an additional license.
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		The Font Software is licensed only for use on specific domain names annexed hereto in Exhibit A. The list of domains may be amended or modified only with the express written permission of Type Supply. The Font Software may be used on any number of sub-domains and top-level domains of the licensed domain names annexed hereto in Exhibit A.
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		The Font Software is licensed for a maximum number of page views per month identified in the schedule annexed hereto in Exhibit A. A page view is defined as a request to load a page that references the Font Software via the CSS @font-face mechanism. If the maximum number of allowed page views is exceeded for three consecutive months an additional license is required. Type Supply reserves the right to request and you hereby agree to provide a report of your page view counts upon request.
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		The Font Software is licensed for use until the expiration date annexed hereto in Exhibit A. If the license has not been renewed after the expiration date, you are not permitted to use the Fonts for any purposes whatsoever.
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		The terms and price associated with this License are based upon the domain names, maximum pages views and expiration date annexed hereto in Exhibit A. If you anticipate an increase in page views, increase in the number of domains or the expiration of the license, you should notify Type Supply as early as possible. You are not entitled to a refund, offset or other adjustment in the event of a reduction in the number of domains, reduction of the number of maximum page views or change in expiration date of the license.
