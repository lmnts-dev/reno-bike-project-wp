These frames are in good shape, some being full suspension bikes, nothing top notch, but fun looking none the less.  I'd think about building a bike around a couple of these and trying them out. One relic I've got is an old two seater, for a couple to tool around on. I was thinking about maybe donating them to you guys, if you want them. All I would ask is a reduction in membership or something like that, so I can hang around and learn some basic bike repair. I can give you a list of what I've actually got over here into next week. I'll have to rent a U-haul to bring it all to the bike project if you want it. Maybe we can work out a deal, such as the membership thing. It is a substantial amount of frames and bike parts. get back to me ! Jason"
