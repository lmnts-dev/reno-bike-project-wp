They are quite old (probably about 20-25 years) but they have been stored inside and serviced periodically. One is a women's Schwinn Woodlands; the other is a men's Schwinn High Plains. We also have a bike rack which will carry both bikes. I need to know if they're something you'd want, and if we have to deliver them to the Bike Project. The latter could be challenging, but if it's worth it, we'll do it."
