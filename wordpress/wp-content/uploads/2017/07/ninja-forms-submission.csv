We are going to Burning Man 2017 and we would like to book 2 bicycles, but we have some questions:

1. If we book and pay the 60 dollars now then when we arrive to your store, do we have to pay any extra taxes? If yes then how much per bicycle?

2. We would like to get the bicycles on on Wednesday 30th of August, what do you think how many reasonable bicycles will be available by then?


Best regards,
Mari-Liis Saretok"
