Hello,

My name is Steve Paul and I am a Digital Marketing Specialists for a Creative Agency.
I was doing some industry benchmarking for a client of mine when I came across your website.
I noticed a few technical errors which correspond with a drop of website traffic over the last 6-8 months which I thought I would bring to your attention.
After closer inspection it appears your site is lacking in 4 key criteria.

1- Website Speed
2- Link Diversity
3- Domain Authority
4- Competition Comparison

I can send you over the report which shows all of the above and so much more which will help you at least improve your site, its rankings and traffic.
I would love the chance to help as well however; this report will at least give you a gauge on the quality of what I do.  If you are interested then please share your requirement and contact details.

Is this the best email to send it to?

Sincerely,
Steve Paul
