Any specific skills, hobbies or activities that could help us? If  you’re good at wrenching, that’s great, but we do need more than bicycle skills. Are you a natural  teacher? Good with computers? Can you carve excellent figurines from soap? Tell us here. Non-  mechanical skills are equally important and useful for RBP, so please list those.","Have you worked with other groups in the past?

I've worked on bikes for a long time. I can weld, too. 
I'm pretty good with computers.","I just moved back to Reno from Boise. While I lived in Boise I volunteered with the bike project there off and on. Always seemed a bit too busy with school to put much in to volunteering there, but always had ambitions to volunteer more. Mostly what I did for them was tear bikes down for parts or build bikes for the youth bike program. I did a little bit of teaching, but not much.
I want to volunteer with you folks because I want more people to ride bikes. ","Lucy Gelb","(510) 914-0385","","lucy.gelb@gmail.com","Andrew Karlson","02/20/2017"
