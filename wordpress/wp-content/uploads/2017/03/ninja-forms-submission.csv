You cannot tell about someone by the way they dress and needless you should show everyone a level of respect.  I've been an avid bicycle rider since i can remember, I ride what gets me around as long as its lightweight and functions.  My favorite is the first aluminum mountain bike that schwinn made when they made good bikes, its now over thirty years old and still rides better than many expensive hardtails.  Dressed in layers because I was off to run my 13 miles on the trail, I probably appeared homeless, and was treated as if i had no business in your store.  Far from the truth I had a couple of nice (500.00)complete bikes i was going to donate, but after looking at the prices that were on the complete refurbished bikes, I realized they were out of the price range for the less fortunate and now looking at donating them to salvation army.
