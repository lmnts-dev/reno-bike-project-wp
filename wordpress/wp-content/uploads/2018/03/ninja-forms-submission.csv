Hi

Hope your business is doing great this year.
 
I was doing some industry benchmarking for a client of mine when I came across your website.

I noticed a few technical errors which correspond with a drop of website traffic over the last 6-8 months which I thought I would bring to your attention.

I was analyzing your site and it seems that some of your website rankings have dropped. It is due to non optimized techniques/errors And Google guidelines not being followed properly. 
 
•	Your web page failed on 4 high priority checks: Meta Description, <h1> Headings Status, Broken Links Test, URL Canonicalization Test
•	Your most common keywords are not appearing in one or more of the meta-tags above. Your primary keywords should appear in your Meta.
•	Site link diversity and Domain Authority is low
•	URL Canonicalization should resolve to the same URL, but currently do not. 
•	5 of them are missing the required 'alt' attribute.
•	Your website should load quicker 
•	Your webpage has so many 'img' tags and 5 of them are missing the required 'alt' attribute. 
•   Your page has more than 20 http requests, which can slow down page loading.
 
I would love the chance to help as well however; this report will at least give you a gauge on the quality of what I do.  If you are interested then please share your requirement and contact details.

Please let me know if we can discuss this.

Thanks
