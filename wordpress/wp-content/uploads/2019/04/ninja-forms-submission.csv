Any specific skills, hobbies or activities that could help us? If  you’re good at wrenching, that’s great, but we do need more than bicycle skills. Are you a natural  teacher? Good with computers? Can you carve excellent figurines from soap? Tell us here. Non-  mechanical skills are equally important and useful for RBP, so please list those.","Have you worked with other groups in the past? Awesome. Tell us about it. What experiences do you have  working as a volunteer? If not, why do you want to volunteer with us?

I commute to work almost all yer round by bike. I'm self taught at bicycle repair. I am currently a high school math and science teacher. I am a certified computer network engineer with several other industry certifications (hardware, software, networking, wireless, etc.). I have been a manager of up to 50 people in retail, government, and military environments. I am very personable, have great people skills, am very meticulous, and organized.","I have never volunteered for more than an event here and there. As a teacher for WCSD, I am looking to volunteer opportunities over the summer for a cause that I believe in. As an avid cyclist I would love the chance to serve the community in this area and I believe in the work that RBP does.","Denise  Mentzer","(775) 342-4824","(775) 342-4824","drm0753@yahoo.com","James Mentzer-Young","04/29/2019"
